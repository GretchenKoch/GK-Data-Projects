# 🐇 Gaming App Project: Rabbit Hole

## 📁 `rabbit-hole-timer`

**Overview**  
*Rabbit Hole* is a gamified Pomodoro-style timer designed to support focus and healthy distraction for users with executive function challenges—whether due to neurodivergence or simply a tendency to follow increasingly irrelevant (but fascinating) tangents.

**Concept**  
Building on the traditional Pomodoro structure, *Rabbit Hole* introduces an animated cartoon rabbit that body doubles with the user. The rabbit works alongside you in its own little home office, typing at a computer during focus sessions. When it's time for a break, the rabbit leans into the screen and climbs through the monitor into a side-scrolling tunnel system—a visual metaphor for entering a “rabbit hole.”

As the rabbit explores, it encounters colorful orbs representing ideas, tabs, or distractions. It can only collect a few before returning to the surface, just in time for the next work cycle. The itch has been addressed—if not thoroughly scratched—and the day is not lost to an insatiable desire to learn everything about leafy sea dragons (as cool as they indisputably are).

**Skills and Tools**  
This project explores animation, behavioral design, and timeboxing mechanics through a Python-based prototype. Future iterations may include more advanced interactions, customizations, and data logging for visualization.

# 🧠 Exploratory Data Analysis Projects

This repository contains two exploratory data analysis (EDA) projects that recruit skills in data wrangling, visualization, and insight generation using Python. Each project focuses on a distinct type of dataset—- one small and community-based, the other large and government-sourced-- to highlight a range of analytical skills.
